# Kruskal-s-algorithm
Kruskal's and Prim's Graph algorithm implemented in C++

DOCUMENTATION------------
A Makefile has been included. After the make command has been issued two output files, "primout.txt" and "kruskalout.txt" will be generated. The format of the output file is as follows; Source Node -> Destination Node followed by the weight of the edge.  At the end of the text file i have output the total weight of the computed MST for both prim's mst and Kruskal's mst. Union by size "rank" was used for Kruskal's algorithm.
